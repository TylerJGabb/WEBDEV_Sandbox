This website is my attempt to interweave THREE.js canvases within the same page.
One of the canvases is in a 200x200 div and I had an idea to use it as a "Preview Window"
where orbits and planets can be previewed before being added.

This is also an exploration into having an animation update properly when changing (set|get)ing properties of a mesh


Things seem to be working well.
