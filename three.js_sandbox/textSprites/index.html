            <li>All sprites in this example had their scales set to the same values.</li>
            <li>They have varying fontsizes.</li>
            <li>Using an extremly high shadow resolution puts a gigantic load on the GPU</li>

                        As can be seeon from the orbiting white ball, there is a problem trying to nail down the exact
                        position of the sprite. I'll have to do a liuttle digging in the function which returns the sprite
                        to find out how to deal with this and locate it's exact location
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This may have something to do with scaling
                    </li>
                </ul>

        </ul>
